## AI Dictionary

A major part of knowledge related to **Artificial Intelligence** is only available in English. **This prevents information and recent discoveries from being equally shared among Spanish and non-Spanish speakers**. 

With the goal of **supporting the understanding of Artificial Intelligence in the LatinX community**, it has been created the [First English-Spanish Dictionary of Technical Terms in Artificial Intelligence (AI)](https://github.com/capitalone/AI_Dictionary_English_Spanish/blob/master/release/AI_Dictionary.pdf).  

Users that may benefit from this dictionary are students, media professionals, and scientific disseminators who need quick and direct access to AI concepts that can be easily shared.

**The first definition of each concept corresponds to a high-level description**. Following explanations provide technical details and mathematical formulations behind the concepts for readers interested in obtaining an advanced understanding. 

The **format** of each entry follows;


- [ ] **Concept** [Translation] -*type* Simple explanation of the technical term. Second level of detail for this concept.
